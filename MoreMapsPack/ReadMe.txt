Q: Is this mod compatible with other parcel / pcp / plot packs?
A: Yes!

Q: What files are overwritten or modified in this mod?
A: None. All the content is new and has unique file names.

Q: What are "Plots", "Parcels", and "PCP's"?
A: At the top level of XCOM 2 map generation, are the map "plots". These are essentially the "city planning" phase of map generation. The level generator picks a plot that fits the criteria of the mission you selected. The plot tells the game where the roads / rivers / overpasses etc are, and where parcels can be placed inside the plot. You can configure what parcels will spawn where, and set the size allowed in each parcel space.

The next stage selects the parcels required to fit the spaces in the plot from the parcel pool. Parcels are small, medium or large pieces of land that contain all the structures, buildings and other large pieces of content that you interact with in XCOM 2. 

The last stage adds all the map pcp's to finish off the look of the level and fill all the remaining gaps and holes. PCP's are essentially things like road pieces, corners, sidewalks, and everything else that isn't a parcel.

Q: Have you optimized this mod with the ModShaderCache.upk edit?
A: This mod doesn't add any new art currently, so there is no ModShaderCache.upk to delete from the mod. If this ever changes, I will of course check to make sure this file isn't present!
