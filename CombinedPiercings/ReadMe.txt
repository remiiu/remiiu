Hey there, beautiful. (~.^)

Mod Description: Adds 26 unique piercing combinations. All variations can be found in the upper and lower face props sections (as well as the helmets/hats section), allowing players to equip more than two sets of piercings and freeing up
more prop slots for additional customization options.

Note: This mod does not modify the default piercings; they're still available in-game as choosable options. It simply adds new variations of them.
