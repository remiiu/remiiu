Title=EnemyLoot
Description=This mod adds in to the loot tables of every enemy a chance to get supplies and alloys in addition to corpses. Take note that only one of these options will drop per kill. It could be a corpse, a few supllies or a couple of alloys. This is to benefit early progression mainly when supplies are needed in great extent, but isn't as extreme as to just double all income.
