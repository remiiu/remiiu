If you sometimes simply forget to use single-AP abilities like aid protocol, quickdraw or reload before shooting, this mod is for you.
It changes the default ability icon colors to reflect their action point cost, so you can see in a glance which actions will end your turn and which won't.

Green = free action
Blue = using ability will not end unit's turn (like a "blue move")
Yellow = using ability will end unit's turn (like a "yellow move")

This is my first attempt at modding X-COM and not (yet) tested very well. Let me know if you encounter any problems.
